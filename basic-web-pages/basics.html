    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <P>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings</P>
</body>
</html>

<h2>List</h2>

<P>This is how you make an unordered list:</P>

<ul>
    <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
    <li>Add each item in its own "li" elemnet</li>
    <li>They don'nt need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>

<p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p>

<ul>
    
<p>Thia is what an ordered list looks like :</p>
<ol>
    <li>notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
    <li>but, the list item elements are the same</li>
    <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
    <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because an ordred list</li>
</ol>
<h2>Inline Element</h2>
<p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attions dto a particular word phrase.</p>

<p>This is some <em>emphasized text</p></em>

<p>other times you need to shout!</strong>ly emphasize the impor of a word or pharase.</p>
